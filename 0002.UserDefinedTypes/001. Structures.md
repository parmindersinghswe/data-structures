### Structures in C# and .NET

#### Overview
A structure in C# is an aggregate data structure, meaning it is a collection of other data elements. Unlike arrays, which contain elements of the same type, structures can contain fields of different types. Fields in a structure are accessed by name, whereas array elements are accessed by position.

#### Defining a New Type
Structures define a new type, a new kind of data type that the compiler regards as a unit.

**Example:**
```csharp
struct Motor
{
    public float Volts;  // Voltage of the motor
    public float Amps;   // Amperage of the motor
    public int Phases;   // Number of phases of the motor
    public float Rpm;    // Rotational speed of the motor
}
```

#### Declaring Structure Variables
- Declaring individual variables of type `Motor`:
  ```csharp
  Motor p, q, r;
  ```
  This declares and sets aside storage for three variables: `p`, `q`, and `r`, each of type `Motor`.

- Declaring an array of structures:
  ```csharp
  Motor[] motors = new Motor[25];
  ```
  This declares a 25-element array of `Motor` structures, allocating 25 units of storage, each one big enough to hold the data of one motor.

- Declaring a pointer to a structure (in an unsafe context):
  ```csharp
  unsafe
  {
      Motor* m;
  }
  ```
  This declares a pointer to an object of type `Motor`.

#### Accessing Members of a Structure
- For a single structure:
  ```csharp
  Motor p;
  p.Volts = 120.0f;  // Setting the voltage
  p.Amps = 15.0f;    // Setting the amperage
  p.Phases = 3;      // Setting the number of phases
  p.Rpm = 3000.0f;   // Setting the rotational speed
  ```

- For an array of structures:
  ```csharp
  Motor[] motors = new Motor[10];
  motors[0].Volts = 120.0f;  // Setting the voltage of the first motor
  motors[0].Rpm = 3000.0f;   // Setting the speed of the first motor
  ```

- Using pointers (in an unsafe context):
  ```csharp
  unsafe
  {
      Motor* p = stackalloc Motor[1];
      p->Volts = 120.0f;  // Setting the voltage using pointer notation
      p->Phases = 3;      // Setting the number of phases using pointer notation
  }
  ```

#### Operations on Structures
- Copy/assign:
  ```csharp
  Motor p, q;
  p = q; // Not Allowed
  p = new Motor { Power = 100 };
  q = new Motor { Power = 200 };
  p = q; //Allowed

  ```

- Get address:
  ```csharp
  unsafe
  {
    Motor p;
    Motor* s = &p;
  }
  ```

- Access members:
  ```csharp
  unsafe
  {
    Motor p;
    Motor* s = &p;
    p.Volts = 120.0f;
    s->Amps = 15.0f;
    Console.WriteLine(p.Amps);
  }
  ```

#### Example of a Struct with Pointers
```csharp
struct Item
{
    public string Name;
    public Item* Next;  // Pointer to another Item
}

// Creating a list of items
unsafe
{
    Item item1, item2;
    item1.Name = "Item1";
    item2.Name = "Item2";
    item1.Next = &item2;
}
```

#### Recursively Defined Structures
You can't have a structure that contains an instance of itself as a member because it would be infinitely large. However, within a structure, you can refer to structures of the same type via pointers.

**Example:**
```csharp
struct TreeNode
{
    public string Label;
    public TreeNode* LeftChild;
    public TreeNode* RightChild;
}
```

#### Typedef Equivalent in C#
In C#, you can use `using` statements to create type aliases, similar to `typedef` in C/C++.

**Example:**
```csharp
using MotorType = Motor;

MotorType m, n;
MotorType[] motors = new MotorType[25];
MotorType Function(MotorType motor) { ... }
```

Using `using` statements for type aliases provides convenience in naming, clarifies the purpose of the type, makes code cleaner and more readable, and enhances portability across different platforms.

**Example of Typedef:**
```csharp
using StringAlias = string;
using NodePointer = TreeNode*;
```
