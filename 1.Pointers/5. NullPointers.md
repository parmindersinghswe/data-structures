# Understanding NULL Pointers in C#

---

### Introduction to NULL Pointers

- **NULL in C#**
  - In C#, `null` is used to represent the absence of an object or reference.
  - By convention, a pointer with the value `null` is referred to as a "null pointer".
  - Address zero is typically not used directly in C#; instead, `null` serves this purpose in the managed environment.

### Usage of NULL Pointers

- **Initialization**
  - `null` indicates that the pointer does not point to any object or variable.
  - It is often used when pointers are declared or initialized:
    ```csharp
    int* pInt = null;
    ```

- **Function Return Values**
  - `null` is also used as a return value for functions that return a pointer to indicate function failure:
    ```csharp
    int* myPtr;
    myPtr = MyFunction();
    if (myPtr == null)
    {
        // Handle the error
    }
    ```

### Runtime Exceptions with NULL Pointers

- **Dereferencing NULL**
  - Dereferencing a pointer whose value is `null` will result in a runtime exception.
    ```csharp
    int* ptr = null;
    *ptr = 10; // This will throw a NullReferenceException
    ```

  The above code will result in an exception like:
  ```
  Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
  ```
