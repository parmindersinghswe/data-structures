# Pointer Initialization

Like any other variable, a pointer must be initialized before it can be used.
We can initialize it to `null`:
```csharp
int* ptr = null;
```
We can also initialize it to the address of another variable:
```csharp
int num;
int* numPtr = &num;
```
Similarly, we can initialize it to the address of an array:
```csharp
int[] val = new int[5];
fixed (int* valPtr = val)
{
    // Use valPtr here
}
```
Note - The initial value must have the correct type.
