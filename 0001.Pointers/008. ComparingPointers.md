### Comparing Pointers

- **Pointer Comparisons**
  - Pointers can also be compared using `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`:
    ```csharp
    if (p == q) { /* Pointers are equal */ }
    if (p != q) { /* Pointers are not equal */ }
    if (p < q) { /* p is less than q */ }
    if (p > q) { /* p is greater than q */ }
    if (p <= q) { /* p is less than or equal to q */ }
    if (p >= q) { /* p is greater than or equal to q */ }
    ```

- **Comparison Explanation**
  - A pointer `p` is "less than" another pointer `q` if the address currently stored in `p` is smaller than the address currently stored in `q`.

- **Usefulness of Comparisons**
  - It is rarely useful to compare pointers with `<` unless both `p` and `q` point to variables in the same array.

- **Common Comparisons**
  - Check for null pointer:
    ```csharp
    if (p == null) { /* p is a null pointer */ }
    ```
  - Check if two pointers are pointing to the same variable:
    ```csharp
    if (p == q) { /* p and q are pointing to the same variable */ }
    ```

- **Note:**
  - `(*p == *q)` means they are pointing to equivalent data, but not necessarily the same data.
    ```csharp
    if (*p == *q) { /* p and q point to equivalent data */ }
    ```
