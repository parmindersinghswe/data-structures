### Arithmetic Operations on Pointers

- **Valid Pointer Arithmetic Operations**
  1. Adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer (`p Â± i`):
     ```csharp
     int* p = ...;
     p = p + 1; // Moves to the next integer
     p = p - 1; // Moves to the previous integer
     ```
  2. Assignment of pointers of the same type (`p = q`):
     ```csharp
     int* p1 = ...;
     int* p2 = p1; // Allowed
     ```
  3. Subtracting or comparing two pointers in the same array (`p - q`):
     ```csharp
      int* p1 = ...;
     int* p2 = ...;
     long difference = p1 - p2; // Difference in elements
     ```
  4. Assigning or comparing to `null` (`p = null`):
     ```csharp
     int* p = null; // Assigning to null
     if (p == null) { /* p is a null pointer */ }
     ```

- **Note:**
  - All other pointer arithmetic operations are illegal.

### Rules for Pointer Arithmetic Operations

- The following rules apply when performing arithmetic operations on pointer variables:
  - `Address + Number = Address`:
    ```csharp
    int* p = ...;
    p = p + 3; // Valid
    ```
  - `Address - Number = Address`:
    ```csharp
    int* p = ...;
    p = p - 3; // Valid
    ```
  - `Address - Address = Number`:
    ```csharp
    int* p1 = ...;
    int* p2 = ...;
    long difference = p1 - p2; // Valid
    ```
  - `Address + Address` is not allowed:
    ```csharp
    int* p1 = ...;
    int* p2 = ...;
    // p1 + p2; // Not allowed
    ```

---

### Pointer Increments

- **Incrementing and Decrementing Pointers**
  - Pointers can be incremented and decremented.
  - If `p` is a pointer to a particular type, `p + 1` yields the correct address of the next variable of the same type.
    ```csharp
    int* p = ...;
    p = p + 1; // Moves to the next integer
    p++; // Equivalent to p + 1
    ```

- **Example**
  - Given `int* p`:
    ```csharp
    p + 1; // Means p + sizeof(int)
    p++; // Equivalent to p + 1
    p += 1; // Equivalent to p + 1
    p + 4; // Means p + (4 * sizeof(int))
    ```

- **Memory Address Example**
  - If `char a[3]`, `int b[3]`, and `float c[3]`:
    - `a + 1` points to the next `char` (address increases by 1 byte).
    - `b + 1` points to the next `int` (address increases by 4 bytes).
    - `c + 1` points to the next `float` (address increases by 4 bytes).
    - `c + 2` points to the second next `float` (address increases by 8 bytes).

### Storage of Values in Memory

- **Coercion**
  - The same memory location can be interpreted in different ways:
    - `long int` interpreted as 1 long int: `0x41434547`
    - `short int` interpreted as 2 short ints: `0x4547` and `0x4143`
    - `char` interpreted as 4 chars: `'G'`, `'E'`, `'C'`, `'A'`

- **Note:**
  - All numbers in this example are in the hexadecimal system.
  - Higher bits are stored in a higher address.

### Pointer to Pointer

- **Example**
  ```csharp
  int i;
  int* pi = &i; 
  int** ppi = &pi;
  i = 5;
  ```

- **Memory Representation**
------------------------------------------
| Variable | Address | Value at address |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| i        | 100     | 5                |
| pi       | 104     | 100              |
| ppi      | 108     | 104              |
-----------------------------------------
  ### Explaination:
  - `i` at address `100` with value `5`
  - `pi` at address `104` pointing to `100`
  - `ppi` at address `108` pointing to `104`

- **Value Access**
  ```csharp
  **ppi = *pi = i = 5;
  ```

### Pointer Operations

- **Example Code and Output**
  ```csharp
  int x;
  int *p = &x;
  x = 0;
  while (*p == x)
  {
      Console.WriteLine(x);
      *p = *p + 1;
  }
  ```

- **Explanation**
  - This loop will increment the value of `x` and print it until the value changes.

### Pointer Arithmetic with Characters

- **Example Program and Output**
  - Given structure with `char`:
    ```csharp
    void main()
    {
        char* p1, p2;
        p1 = (char*)200;
        p2 = (char*)600;
        Console.WriteLine(p2 - p1);
    }
    ```

- **Explanation**
  - The difference between the pointers will be printed.

---

### Pointer Arithmetic with Integers

- **Example Program and Output**
  - Given structure with `int`:
    ```csharp
    void main()
    {
        int* p1, p2;
        p1 = (int*)200;
        p2 = (int*)600;
        Console.WriteLine(p2 - p1);
    }
    ```

- **Explanation**
  - The difference between the integer pointers will be printed.

---

### Pointer Arithmetic with Double

- **Example Program and Output**
  - Given structure with `double`:
    ```csharp
    void main()
    {
      double* p1, p2;
      p1 = (double*)200;
      p2 = (double*)600;
      Console.WriteLine(p2 - p1);
    }
    ```

- **Explanation**
  - The difference between the double pointers will be printed.
