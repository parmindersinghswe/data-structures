## Size of Variables

- **Note:**
  - Pointers are all the same size. On most computers, a pointer variable is four bytes (32 bits).
  - However, the variable that a pointer points to can be of arbitrary sizes. For example:
    - A `char*` pointer points to variables that are one byte long.
    - A `double*` pointer points to variables that are eight bytes long.

- **`sizeof` Operator**
  - The `sizeof` operator gets a variable or a type as an input and outputs its size in bytes:
    ```csharp
    double x;
    int s1 = sizeof(double); // s1 is 8
    int s2 = sizeof(int);    // s2 is 4
    ```

- **Pointer Arithmetic**
  - When pointer arithmetic is performed, the actual address stored in the pointer is computed based on the size of the variables being pointed at.
