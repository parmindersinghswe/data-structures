# Working with Pointers in C#

---

### Assignment

- **Pointer Assignment**
  - The value of one pointer variable can be assigned to another pointer variable of the same type:
    ```csharp
    int* ptr1;
    int* ptr2;
    ptr1 = ptr2; // Assigning ptr2 to ptr1
    ```

---

### Relational Operations

- **Pointer Comparison**
  - Two pointer variables of the same type can be compared for equality:
    ```csharp
    if (ptr1 == ptr2)
    {
        // Pointers are equal
    }
    if (ptr1 != ptr2)
    {
        // Pointers are not equal
    }
    ```

### Arithmetic Operations

- **Pointer Arithmetic**
  - Some limited arithmetic operations are allowed with pointers:
    - **Addition and Subtraction with Integers**
      - Integer values can be added to or subtracted from a pointer variable:
        ```csharp
        int* ptr = &someInt;
        ptr = ptr + 1; // Move to the next integer in memory
        ptr = ptr - 1; // Move to the previous integer in memory
        ```

    - **Subtraction of Pointers**
      - The value of one pointer variable can be subtracted from another pointer variable to determine the distance between them:
        ```csharp
        int* ptr1 = &array[0];
        int* ptr2 = &array[5];
        int distance = ptr2 - ptr1; // Distance between ptr1 and ptr2
        ```
